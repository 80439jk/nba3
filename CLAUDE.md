# CLAUDE.md — National Benefit Alliance (nba3)

## Project Overview

National Benefit Alliance (NBA) is a lead-generation website that connects U.S. residents with free government benefit programs. The site is organized by state and county, with a multi-step application funnel. It is deployed on **Vercel** at **https://nba3.vercel.app**.

- **Stack**: Static HTML + serverless API routes (Vercel Functions), no frontend framework for the main site
- **Node**: >=18.x
- **Dependencies**: `pg` (PostgreSQL), `nodemailer` (email)
- **Tracking**: Google Tag Manager (GTM-MTQ5WNFR) — installed on every HTML page sitewide
- **Domain**: nationalbenefitalliance.com
- **Architecture**: No global layout/template system — every HTML file is fully self-contained (own `<head>`, `<style>`, `<body>`). Sitewide changes require touching every file individually or via script.

## A/B Testing — Two Live Funnels

Both funnels are **live in production simultaneously** as of April 2026. `/apply/1/` is the control; `/apply/2/` is the variant. They share the same Supabase edge function for lead submission and the same `nba_funnel` sessionStorage key/helpers (`saveFunnelData`, `getFunnelData`).

---

## The Apply Funnel (`/apply/1/`) — Control

There are **two parallel funnel implementations** in this directory:

### Active Funnel (Static HTML — USE THIS)
These are the pages currently in production and what the owner wants to iterate on:

| URL Path | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/apply/1` | `apply/1/index.html` | Funnel landing page |
| `/apply/1/step-1` | `apply/1/step-1/index.html` | Step 1: Select your state |
| `/apply/1/step-2` | `apply/1/step-2/index.html` | Step 2: Basic info (DOB, citizenship) |
| `/apply/1/step-3` | `apply/1/step-3/index.html` | Step 3: Address (street, city, ZIP) |
| `/apply/1/step-4` | `apply/1/step-4/index.html` | Step 4: Household & income details |
| `/apply/1/step-5` | `apply/1/step-5/index.html` | Step 5: Contact info (name, email, phone + TCPA consent + honeypot + time-trap) |
| `/apply/1/thank-you` | `apply/1/thank-you/index.html` | Thank-you / call CTA page |

Each file is **self-contained** — all CSS is in an embedded `<style>` tag in `<head>` (no external CSS). Each file is ~1,300–1,450 lines. The CSS is duplicated across all 7 files.

### Inactive Funnel (React SPA — DO NOT USE for production changes)
These exist but are **not** the active production pages:

| URL Path | File |
|---|---|
| `/apply/1/start` | `apply/1/start/index.html` |
| `/apply/1/form/1-state` | `apply/1/form/1-state/index.html` |
| `/apply/1/form/2-basic-info` | `apply/1/form/2-basic-info/index.html` |
| `/apply/1/form/3-address` | `apply/1/form/3-address/index.html` |
| `/apply/1/form/4-household-income` | `apply/1/form/4-household-income/index.html` |
| `/apply/1/form/5-contact` | `apply/1/form/5-contact/index.html` |
| `/apply/1/thankyou` | `apply/1/thankyou/index.html` |

These are all React SPA shells (`<div id="root"></div>`) that load the **same Vite bundle**:
- `apply/1/assets/index-DOVXZXY4.js` — minified React 18.3.1 + app code (~115k tokens)
- `apply/1/assets/index-QQQfERWU.css` — compiled Tailwind CSS

**Important**: The SPA pages represent the **target design** that the static pages should match visually. The SPA uses the navy/amber color scheme described below.

---

## The Apply Funnel (`/apply/2/`) — A/B Variant

Created April 2026 as a redesigned landing experience to A/B test against `/apply/1/`. The key difference is the landing page (`/apply/2/index.html`) — the form steps are structurally identical to apply/1 but with descriptive URL slugs and progress updated to "Step X of 4."

### URL Structure

| URL Path | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/apply/2/` | `apply/2/index.html` | **Card-based hero landing page** (state + needs selection) |
| `/apply/2/step-1-dob-citizen/` | `apply/2/step-1-dob-citizen/index.html` | DOB & citizenship (was apply/1/step-2) |
| `/apply/2/step-2-address/` | `apply/2/step-2-address/index.html` | Address (was apply/1/step-3) |
| `/apply/2/step-3-income-employ/` | `apply/2/step-3-income-employ/index.html` | Income & employment (was apply/1/step-4) |
| `/apply/2/step-4-contact/` | `apply/2/step-4-contact/index.html` | Contact info + TCPA (was apply/1/step-5) |
| `/apply/2/thank-you/` | `apply/2/thank-you/index.html` | Thank-you page (identical to apply/1) |

**Note:** apply/2 skips the state-selection step entirely — state is collected on the landing page itself via the hero card dropdown. This means the funnel is effectively one step shorter from the user's perspective.

### Landing Page Design (`/apply/2/index.html`)

The hero sits on a navy gradient background and contains a single white card with two sections:

**Step 1 — "What brings you here today?"**
- 4 tile-style checkboxes in a single row: Food & Groceries, Utility Bills, Housing & Rent, Other
- Each tile has an icon, label, and amber checkbox indicator (top-right corner)
- Selections are stored in `nba_funnel.needs` (array of values) via sessionStorage
- Tiles use amber accent on selection (`border-color: amber-500`, `background: amber-50`)

**Step 2 — "Where do you live?"**
- Native `<select>` styled with a custom wrapper (`.hero__select-wrap`)
- **Normal state**: amber outline (`border: 2.5px solid amber-500`), light amber tint background (`#fef8ee`), amber chevron box with navy arrow icon
- **Hover state**: navy outline (reversed from normal), navy shadow
- Selecting a state auto-advances to step-1-dob-citizen — no button needed
- State value stored in `nba_funnel.state` before navigation

**Card trust marks** (inside card, below dropdown):
- ✓ 100% free · ✓ No SSN needed · ✓ Takes 2 minutes

**Trust badges section** (white section immediately below hero):
- BBB Accredited, 100% Free to Apply, No SSN Needed to Start, Private & Confidential
- Amber icon on amber-50 circular background, bold navy text, 2×2 grid (4-column on desktop)

**Below-hero sections** (unchanged from original apply/1 content):
- Programs card ("Get Matched To Programs In One Quick Call")
- How It Works (3 steps)
- Mid-page CTA button ("See Available Programs" → scrolls to top of page)
- What To Expect On Your Call
- Final dark navy CTA section
- Footer

**All lower-page CTAs** say "See Available Programs" and scroll back to top (`window.scrollTo({top:0,behavior:'smooth'})`) rather than deep-linking to step-1, since the user must first complete the hero card.

### Key Design Choices for apply/2 Landing Page

- **Step number badges**: amber circle (`background: amber-500`), navy number text, aligned inline with section heading via flex `align-items: baseline`
- **Headline**: sentence case, no "Programs" — "Get matched to assistance that can help right away"
- **Subheadline**: "Talk to a specialist. See what you qualify for. Free, fast, confidential, no commitment."
- **No progress bar** on the landing page (removed in favor of step badges inside the card)
- **Desktop**: hero padding reduced, headline capped at `1.875rem` so the full card fits above the fold at 800px viewport height
- **Mobile**: everything through "Real People, Real Benefits" visible above fold

### Deferred Enhancements (apply/2)
- Social proof feed ("X neighbors in [city] got matched this week") — removed for now, adds complexity. Will add when a real data feed is available.

## Design System

### Target Design (Navy/Amber — what we're moving toward)
The SPA funnel uses this scheme. The static pages are being updated to match.

**Colors:**
- Navy-900: `#1a2b47` (header bg, hero bg, dark sections)
- Navy-800: `#1e3a5f` (header border, gradients)
- Navy-50: `#e6eff9` (light card backgrounds)
- Navy-100: `#ccdaf0` (borders)
- Amber-500: `#f59e0b` (primary CTA buttons, progress bars, accents)
- Amber-600: `#d97706` (button hover states)
- Amber-50: `#fffbeb` (light amber backgrounds)
- Amber-100: `#fef3c7` (amber borders, pulse animation)
- Gray scale: standard Tailwind grays (#f9fafb through #111827)

**Typography:**
- Body: System sans-serif (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto...`)
- Headings: `'Poppins', 'Segoe UI', system-ui, sans-serif`

**Key Components:**
- Header: Sticky, dark navy background, white "National Benefit Alliance" text
- Progress bar: Amber fill on gray track, "Step X of Y" + "XX% complete"
- Continue button: Amber-500, bold white text, rounded-lg, shadow
- Back button: Gray-100 bg with gray-300 border, "< Back" text
- Form cards: White, rounded-xl (1rem), soft shadow (`0 10px 40px -10px rgba(0,0,0,.1)`)
- Hero sections: Navy gradient background with white text
- CTA buttons: All amber (not green)
- Call button (thank-you page): Amber-500, large with phone icon

**apply/2 Landing Page Additional Components:**
- Hero card: white, `border-radius: 1rem`, `box-shadow: 0 20px 60px -10px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)`, on navy background
- Step badge: `width/height: 1.5rem`, `border-radius: 50%`, `background: amber-500`, `color: navy-900`
- Tile grid: `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); gap: 0.5rem`
- Dropdown wrapper (`.hero__select-wrap`): relative positioned, contains native select + absolutely-positioned chevron box
- Chevron box (`.hero__select-chevron-box`): `background: amber-500`, `border-radius: 0.375rem`, `1.875rem × 1.875rem`, navy arrow SVG inside

### Legacy Design (Blue/Green — being replaced)
The static pages originally used:
- Blue-600: `#2563eb` (buttons, progress, accents)
- Green-600: `#16a34a` (CTA buttons)
- White header with gray border
- Blue progress bar fill
- Blue "Continue" buttons, green hero/CTA buttons

## Phone Numbers & Call Conversion Tracking

- **Current number**: `1-888-408-5650` / `tel:18884085650`
- **Previous number**: `1-855-767-9422` / `tel:18557679422` (replaced)
- Phone number appears on the thank-you page in **two** places only (entire `/apply/` directory verified):
  1. Display text: `<p class="ty-phone-number">1-888-408-5650</p>` (line 1227)
  2. `<a href="tel:18884085650" class="ty-call-btn">` call button (line 1223)
- **Google Forwarding Number (GFN) swap** is handled via GTM — no hard-coded WCM/DNI script on the page. The GTM container must have a "Google Ads Call Conversion (from website)" tag configured with Conversion ID + phone number `1-888-408-5650` firing on the thank-you page for the swap to work.
- **Call button**: plain `<a href="tel:...">` — no JS interceptors, no `onclick`, no `preventDefault`. Works natively on mobile (opens dialer) and desktop (opens system handler).
- **Conversion tracking** depends on GTM triggers: button click trigger (Click URL matches `^tel:` or Click Classes contains `ty-call-btn`) and the GFN call duration tag (Google-side, >20s connected call).
- **Attribution**: Google Ads `_gcl_aw` cookie (90-day lifespan) persists through the multi-step funnel. The step-5→thank-you redirect clears `sessionStorage.nba_funnel` but this doesn't affect Google attribution since it uses cookies, not sessionStorage.

---

## Vercel Configuration

From `vercel.json`:
- Clean URLs enabled (no `.html` extensions)
- Trailing slashes disabled
- Rewrites: `/search` → `/api/search`, `/sitemap.xml` → `/api/sitemap`, `/humans.txt` → `/api/humans`
- Security headers: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`
- Cache: CSS/JS immutable (1yr), SPA assets immutable (1yr)

---

## Key Preferences & Decisions

1. **Static HTML over SPA for production** — The owner prefers the static HTML funnel (`/step-1` through `/step-5`) over the React SPA (`/form/1-state` through `/form/5-contact`) for the production funnel, even though the SPA has the desired design
2. **Self-contained pages** — Each HTML page contains its own CSS in `<style>` tags; no shared external stylesheet for the funnel
3. **Design direction** — Moving from blue/green scheme to navy/amber to match the SPA's look
4. **Phone number changes** should be updated in BOTH the static pages AND the React bundle
5. **GTM tracking** is on every HTML page sitewide (GTM-MTQ5WNFR) — both the `<head>` script snippet and `<body>` noscript iframe. Originally only the 17 `/apply/1/` pages had GTM; it was rolled out to all ~3,259 pages in April 2026. **Note**: The 6 individual story pages (`stories/*.html`, not `stories/index.html`) use a different file naming convention (flat `.html` files, not `directory/index.html`) so they can be missed by scripts that only target `index.html`.
6. **The funnel collects**: state, DOB, citizenship status, address, household income, employment status, name, email, phone (with TCPA consent). Also captures UTM params (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`) and click IDs (`gclid`, `wbraid`, `gbraid`) via `captureUTM()` on every page.
7. **Thank-you page** generates a random 5-digit reference number and pulls user info from sessionStorage (`nba_ty`). Reference number regenerates on page refresh (not persisted to sessionStorage — known minor UX issue).
8. **Frontend→backend payload** includes `hp_website` (honeypot) and `form_duration_ms` (time-trap) fields for server-side bot detection. `transaction_id` is a UUID generated via `crypto.randomUUID()` on first page load.

## Completed Work

- **GTM sitewide rollout (April 2026)** — Added GTM-MTQ5WNFR container (head script + body noscript) to all 3,247 HTML pages that were missing it. The 17 `/apply/1/` pages already had it and were left untouched (no duplicates). A subsequent audit found 6 individual story pages (`stories/from-crisis-to-calling.html`, `stories/hope-at-home.html`, `stories/keeping-the-lights-on.html`, `stories/more-than-a-meal.html`, `stories/neighbors-helping-neighbors.html`, `stories/ten-thousand-families.html`) were still missing GTM — these were added in a follow-up commit. All 3,259 HTML files now have GTM (verified: every file has exactly 2 GTM-MTQ5WNFR references — one head script, one body noscript).
- **Restyled the static funnel pages** (`/apply/1/index.html`, `step-1` through `step-5`, `thank-you`) from blue/green to navy/amber to match the SPA design. Key changes:
  - Header: white → dark navy
  - Progress bar: blue → amber
  - Continue buttons: blue → amber
  - Hero/CTA sections: blue/green gradients → navy/amber
  - Form cards: rounder corners, softer shadows
  - Call button on thank-you: green → amber
- **UTM & click ID tracking fixes (April 2026):**
  - Identified Google Ads tracking template typo (`source=google` instead of `utm_source=google`) — user corrected in Google Ads UI
  - Identified sitelink URL `#fragment` anchors swallowing query params — user removed fragments
  - Removed redundant `gclid={gclid}` from tracking template (auto-tagging handles it)
  - Added `wbraid`/`gbraid` (iOS 14+ privacy-safe click IDs) capture to all 6 funnel pages (`captureUTM()` array extended) and step-5 payload
  - Edge function updated to store `wbraid`/`gbraid` in leads table and use `gclid → wbraid → gbraid` fallback chain for CallTools `click_id`
- **CRM response handling fix (April 2026):** Fixed 24.2% null `crm_lead_id` rate by handling CallTools duplicate-merge response shape (`duplicate_contacts[0]`). Added `crm_action` column. Backfilled 89 historical rows.
- **Transaction ID switched to UUID (April 2026):** Changed `getTransactionId()` on all 6 funnel pages from `'nba_' + Date.now() + '_' + rand` to `crypto.randomUUID()`. Column type remains `text`.
- **Bot detection (April 2026):** Added honeypot field + time-trap to step-5 and edge function. Created `bot_drops` table. Bots get silent 200 OK, never enter `leads` or CallTools.
- **Failure alert emails (April 2026):** Integrated Resend (free tier) into edge function. Sends email to `larazielin1@gmail.com` on every CallTools API failure with full error details + lead info.
- **apply/2 A/B variant (April 2026):** Built and launched `/apply/2/` as a card-based redesign of the landing page for A/B testing. Descriptive step URLs (`step-1-dob-citizen`, `step-2-address`, `step-3-income-employ`, `step-4-contact`). State and needs (tile selections) captured on the landing page; funnel is one step shorter. Merged to main via squash merge from branch `landing-page-v2`.
- **Large HTML edits via Python (April 2026):** When Claude's output filter blocks large HTML generation, the workaround is to write a Python script via the Bash tool that reads/modifies the file directly — avoiding any large HTML in Claude's response output.

---

## Important: Sitewide Changes

Because there is **no global layout or template**, any change that needs to apply to all pages (e.g., header updates, new tracking scripts, footer changes) requires modifying each HTML file individually. The proven approach is a `find` + `sed` script that:
1. Targets all `index.html` files (excluding `node_modules/` and `backend/`)
2. Skips files that already have the change (to avoid duplicates)
3. Uses consistent HTML patterns: all files have a plain `<head>` tag and a plain `<body>` tag (no attributes)

County pages use `<html lang="en" prefix="og: https://ogp.me/ns#">` while core/state pages use `<html lang="en">`.

---

## Supabase Edge Function Backend (separate repo)

The lead submission flow for the apply funnel is handled by a **Supabase Edge Function** in a separate repo at `/Users/larazielin/Desktop/nba/nba-supabase-backend/`.

### Function: `submit-lead`
- **File**: `supabase/functions/submit-lead/index.ts`
- **Trigger**: Called by the funnel when the user completes step 5 (contact info + TCPA consent)
- **Supabase project ID**: `quhxbgsgtfvrasyjvaba` (region: us-east-2, Postgres 17)

### Flow
1. Parses the incoming JSON payload (`LeadPayload` interface)
2. Extracts client IP from `x-forwarded-for` / `cf-connecting-ip`
3. **Bot detection** — checks honeypot field (`hp_website`) and time-trap (`form_duration_ms < 3000`). If bot suspected: logs to `bot_drops` table, returns fake 200 OK, skips leads insert + CallTools entirely
4. Inserts into the `leads` table with `crm_status: "pending"`
5. Forwards the lead to the CRM (CallTools) with `gclid → wbraid → gbraid` click ID fallback chain
6. Logs the full request + response to `api_logs`
7. Updates `leads.crm_status` to `"success"` or `"failed"`
8. **On failure**: sends an alert email via Resend to `larazielin1@gmail.com` with lead details + CallTools error response
9. Always returns HTTP 200 `{ success: true, transaction_id }` to the frontend regardless of CRM outcome

### CRM Integration — CallTools (current)
- **Endpoint**: `POST https://app.calltools.io/api/contacts/`
- **Auth**: `Authorization: Token <CALLTOOLS_API_TOKEN>` header
- **Body format**: JSON
- **Hardcoded fields**: `status: "new"`, `do_not_contact: false`, `add_tags: [268591]`
- **Field transformations applied before sending:**
  - `phone` → `home_phone_number` as E.164 (`+1XXXXXXXXXX` for 10 digits; `+XXXXXXXXXXX` for 11 digits starting with `1`; `+<digits>` otherwise; empty string if no digits)
  - `dob` → `age` (derived; omitted if DOB invalid)
  - `tcpa_consent` (boolean) → string `"true"` / `"false"` (CallTools rejects booleans)
  - `annual_income` enum → numeric: `under_50k`→50000, `50k_75k`→75000, `76k_150k`→150000, `150k_plus`→150001 (CallTools requires a number)
  - `street_address` → `address`, `zip` → `zip_code`, `jornaya_leadid` → `jornaya_lead_id`
- **Click ID handling**: Uses a fallback chain `gclid → wbraid → gbraid` for the `click_id` field, so iOS 14+ privacy-safe Google Ads clicks (which use `wbraid`/`gbraid` instead of `gclid`) still get a click ID sent to CallTools. All three are also sent as separate fields.
- **Response handling**: Treats any 2xx as success. Two response shapes:
  - **Fresh create**: returns contact object with `id` field → extracted as `crm_lead_id`, `crm_action` set to `"CREATE"`
  - **Duplicate merge**: returns `{ duplicate_contacts: [<id>], duplicate_action: "MERGE" }` → `crm_lead_id` extracted from `duplicate_contacts[0]`, `crm_action` set to `"MERGE"`
  - Extraction chain: `response.id ?? response.contact_id ?? response.uid ?? duplicate_contacts[0] ?? null`

### Previous CRM — Trackdrive (REMOVED)
The function previously forwarded to `https://quotes-direct-llc.trackdrive.com/api/v1/leads` with URL query-param auth (`CRM_LEAD_TOKEN`). Fully removed — no references remain in the codebase. `CRM_LEAD_TOKEN` env var can be unset.

### Environment Variables (Supabase Edge Function Secrets)
| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase client init |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase client auth |
| `CALLTOOLS_API_TOKEN` | CallTools API auth (guarded — throws clear error if missing) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend email API key (free tier, `re_...`) for failure alert emails |

### Database Tables
- **`leads`** — one row per submission. Columns include: `transaction_id` (text, UUID format via `crypto.randomUUID()`), `state`, `dob`, `citizenship`, `street_address`, `city`, `zip`, `annual_income`, `employment_status`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `tcpa_consent`, `ip_address`, `jornaya_leadid`, `crm_status` (`pending`/`success`/`failed`), `crm_lead_id`, `crm_action` (`CREATE`/`MERGE`), `crm_submitted_at`, `gclid`, `wbraid`, `gbraid`, `utm_*`.
- **`api_logs`** — one row per CRM call. Columns: `lead_id`, `transaction_id`, `caller_id`, `request_payload` (jsonb), `response_payload` (jsonb), `http_status`, `success`, `error_message`.
- **`bot_drops`** — one row per suspected bot submission (silently dropped, never enters `leads` or CallTools). Columns: `id` (bigint identity), `created_at` (timestamptz), `ip_address`, `user_agent`, `detection_reason` (`honeypot_filled` / `too_fast`), `form_duration_ms`, `raw_payload` (jsonb). RLS enabled.

### Schema Changes Applied
- **`transaction_id`** column on both `leads` and `api_logs` was migrated from `uuid` → `text`. The frontend now generates proper UUIDs via `crypto.randomUUID()` (switched from the old `nba_<timestamp>_<rand>` format in April 2026), but the column remains `text` type for backwards compatibility with older rows.
- **`crm_action`** column added to `leads` (text, nullable) — stores `"CREATE"` or `"MERGE"` based on CallTools response shape. 89 historical merge rows were backfilled.
- **`wbraid`** and **`gbraid`** columns added to `leads` (text, nullable) — iOS 14+ privacy-safe Google Ads click IDs.
- **`bot_drops`** table created for bot detection logging (see Database Tables above).

### Known Quirks / Compatibility Notes
- The function **always returns HTTP 200** even when CRM submission fails. Frontend cannot detect CRM failures.
- `jornaya_leadid` falls back to the literal string `"STATIC_JORNAYA_ID_PLACEHOLDER"` if empty.
- CallTools validates phone numbers for real-world dialability — obviously fake test numbers like `+12222222222` are rejected at the CRM layer (not a code bug).
- No input validation, no retries. CRM is called exactly once per submission.
- **Failure alert emails** are sent via Resend (free tier, `onboarding@resend.dev` → `larazielin1@gmail.com`). The email includes HTTP status, CallTools error response, and full lead details. Wrapped in try/catch so email failure never affects the main flow.
- **Bot detection**: honeypot field (`hp_website` — a hidden `<input name="website">` on step-5) and time-trap (`form_duration_ms < 3000`). Bots get a fake 200 OK. Detection is server-side in the edge function — bots that POST directly without visiting the form are caught by the time-trap (duration will be 0 or missing).

### Historical Failure Analysis (as of April 2026, 404 total leads)
| Cause | Count | Real leads lost | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Early dev — unknown lead token (422) | 10 | 0 | Fixed — old endpoint issue |
| Fake/test phone numbers (400) | 2 | 0 | Test data |
| Carrier-rejected phone (400) | 1 | 1 | CallTools-side, can't prevent |
| Invalid DOB month=18 (400) | 1 | 1 | Fixable with frontend validation |
| Type mismatch — tcpa/income (400) | 1 | 0 | Fixed in current code |
